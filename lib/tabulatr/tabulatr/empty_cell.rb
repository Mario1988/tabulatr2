class Tabulatr

  # the method used to actually define the filters of the columns,
  # taking the name of the attribute and a hash of options.
  #
  # The following options are evaluated here:
  # <tt>:filter_html</tt>:: a hash with html-attributes added to the <ts>s created
  # <tt>:filter</tt>:: may take different values:
  #                    <tt>false</tt>:: no filter is output for this column
  #                    a container:: the keys of the hash are used to define a <tt>select</tt>
  #                             where the values are the <tt>value</tt> of the <tt>options</tt>.
  #                    an Array:: the elements of that array are used to define a
  #                               <tt>select</tt>
  #                    a String:: a <tt>select</tt> is created with that String as options
  #                               you can use ActionView#collection_select and the like
  def empty_column(name, opts={}, &block)
    raise "Not in empty mode!" if @row_mode != :empty
    opts = normalize_column_options(name, opts)
    make_tag(:td, opts[:filter_html])
  end
